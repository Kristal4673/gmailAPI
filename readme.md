## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the steps below, ensure that you have the following:

Gmail API credentials: Replace 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID' and 'YOUR_API_KEY' in script.js with your actual Gmail API credentials. If you don't have the credentials, follow the Gmail API documentation to obtain them.

Web server or local development environment: This code needs to be hosted on a web server or a local development environment for it to run. You can use tools like Live Server or XAMPP to set up a local server.

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS): Depending on your server setup, you may need to configure appropriate CORS headers to prevent cross-origin issues. Ensure that the necessary CORS headers are set to allow communication between your web server and the Gmail API.

Enable Gmail API: Make sure you have enabled the Gmail API in the Google Developer Console for your project. Follow the Gmail API documentation for instructions on enabling the API.

## Running the Code

To run the code and send emails using the Gmail API, follow these steps:

Host the files: Host the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files on a web server or set up a local development environment.

Open the application: Open the index.html file in a web browser.

Fill in email details: Enter the recipient's email address, subject, and body of the email in the provided input fields.

Click "Send Email": Click the "Send Email" button to initiate the email sending process.

Authorization: If prompted, sign in with your Gmail account to authorize the application to send emails on your behalf.

Verify the result: Check the status div to see if the email was sent successfully or if any errors occurred.


## Remember to handle your API credentials securely and follow best practices when using API keys and client IDs in production environments.

That's it! You can now use the provided steps to add and run your code with the Gmail API integration.
